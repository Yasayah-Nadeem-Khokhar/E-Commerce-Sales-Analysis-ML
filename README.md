# **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project leverages machine learning and statistical modeling to analyze e-commerce sales data, predict revenue trends, segment customers, and identify key factors influencing product success. The insights gained help businesses optimize marketing strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction.

## **Objectives**
- **Sales Prediction:** Forecast revenue trends and demand fluctuations.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Cluster customers based on purchasing behavior for targeted marketing.
- **Product Insights:** Identify top-performing product categories and their contribution to revenue.
- **Trend Analysis:** Analyze seasonal variations and promotional campaign impacts.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- **Product Information:** Product ID, Category, Price.
- **Sales Data:** Quantity sold, Revenue generated.
- **Temporal & Regional Data:** Time of purchase, Geographic location.
- **Customer Metrics:** Demographic attributes, Purchase frequency.

## **Models Used**
### **1. Sales Prediction Models**
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- XGBoost
- ARIMA

### **2. Clustering Models**
- K-Means
- DESCAN

### **3. Classification Models**
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

### **4. Time-Series Analysis**
- Prophet
- ARIMA

## **Results & Insights**
- **Prediction Models:** XGBoost and Random Forest achieved high accuracy (RÂ² scores of 0.91 and 0.93).
- **Clustering Models:** Identified three customer segments:
  1. High-value customers (frequent buyers).
  2. Occasional buyers (sales-driven shoppers).
  3. Budget-conscious customers (discount-focused shoppers).
- **Classification Models:** Decision Tree and KNN achieved 85% and 82% accuracy in product demand categorization.

## **Conclusion**
This analysis highlights the power of machine learning in understanding e-commerce trends. Predictive models enhance demand forecasting, clustering models aid customer-centric marketing, and time-series models optimize inventory planning. These insights help businesses increase revenue, reduce risks, and strengthen customer loyalty.
